Please, do not suck my dick because its obfuscated, i dont want to give my worthfull code to any skids selling this shit. Use a HTTPs debugger to see yourself its no backdoor...

Just insert this into your server, it will simply fix all Crasher-Exploits. No ban-system implemented, just use webhook logs (in config) to log the crashers and ban them manually.

The webhook can be grabbed because its loaded shared, so use a custom one.

Its standalone so no framework or shit needed.
